# End-to-End DevOps Project : TO-Do List Application
## ðŸ“Š Description 
This project features a Python Flask application designed for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database . It includes all necessary scripts and Kubernetes manifests for deploying the application alongside the MySQL database on an AWS EKS cluster and Amazon RDS, with accompanying ECR repositories . Additionally, the deployment setup incorporates monitoring through Prometheus and Grafana, as well as a fully integrated CI/CD pipeline .
## Prerequisites 
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements :

- **Python** : Programming Language
- **Docker** : Installed and configured
- **kubectl** : Installed and configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster
- **K9s** : For managing and interacting with Kubernetes clusters more efficiently
- **Terraform** : open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool
- **Helm** : simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes clusters
- **GitHub CLI** : For interacting with GitHub repositories and workflows directly from the command line
- **MySQL** : Open-source relational database management system
- **Beekeeper-Studio** : For Database Access
- **AWS CLI** : For managing AWS services from the command line

## Running Project
### Step 1 : Setting Up the Database
1. Start MySQL server on your machine
2. Create a new MySQL database for the Application
3. Update the database configuration to match your local MySQL settings : 
      ```
       - DB_HOST : localhost
       - DB_USER : Your MySQL username 
       - DB_PASSWORD : Your MySQL password
       - DB_DATABASE : Your Databse name 
      ```
4. Create a table in the database that will be used by your application :
   ```
   CREATE TABLE tasks (
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   description TEXT,
   is_complete BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
    );
   ```

### Step 2 : Running the Application
1. Clone the Repository 
   ```    
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedgamalyousef/ToDo-List-Application.git
   ```
2. Create a Virtual Environment and activate it 
   ```
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   
    ```
3. Install Dependencies 
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ``` 
    
4. Start the Application 
   ```
   python3 app.py
   ``` 
5. Access the Application using the following url  
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
### Step 3 : Dockerizing the Application
1. Build the Docker Image 
 ```
   docker build -t todo-application .
 ```
2. Run the docker container with host network (to access the local MySQL server)  
   ```
   docker run --network=host todo-application
   ```
3. Access the application using the following url 
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
